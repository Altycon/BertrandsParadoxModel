# BertrandsParadoxModel
Attempting to recreate models of Bertrand's Probability Paradox from Numberphile video https://youtu.be/mZBwsm6B280

I have yet to find the time or motivation to continue this. My interests have diverged.
I'm stuck working out calculations for 1/4  and 1/2 probability models. How do I find the center
point of a line drawn between 2 pionts and then draw a chord perpindicular to a line draw to the center
of the circle?  ...relearning trigonomotry while learning JavaScript...f***.
